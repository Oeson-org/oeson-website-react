    <p><b>Prepare for a career, Not a Job</b></p>
    <p>It can be quite challenging to find a job without experience. You look for open positions and thousands of listings come up. As a fresher, you need something that amounts to working knowledge in a given domain to even land a job interview. </p>
    <p><q>As a fresher, you need something that amounts to working knowledge in a given domain to even land a job interview.</q></p>
    <p>Once you get shortlisted for an interview, you should be able to demonstrate domain-specific skills that can be applied on the job. Else you lose to someone who can.</p>
    <p>You have to find ways to bridge this gap between skills mentioned in your resume and your knowledge of applying those in real-time. It helps you better your career prospects. One way to do it is to find an internship in your chosen area of interest. </p>
    <br/>
    
    <p><b>Internships Boost Confidence and add Value to a Resume</b></p>
    <p id="justify">Most first-time interns are in for a big surprise when they begin their internship. Working as an intern is a whole lot different from being a college student. Learning happens on the job. There are no right answers, instead, you learn to ask the right questions.</p>
    <img src="https://oeson.b-cdn.net/New%20folder/how%20internship%20helps_Oeson.jpg" class="image-right" alt="img"/>
     <p>Internships help you acquire a set of skills that can help you in building a career:</p>
     <p>- Problem-solving approach </p>
     <p>- Co-ordination among team members</p>
     <p>- Respecting deadlines</p>
     <p>- Taking feedback constructively</p>
     <p>- Effective communication</p>
     <p>- Confidence</p>
    <p id="justify">When you work in a corporate environment, confidence is your most valuable asset. You will face numerous challenges in a corporate environment, from people management to project management. Internships give you a headstart in this direction and prepare you for a corporate setting. You will thrive if you don’t lose your confidence. </p>

    <p><b>Upskill to get Job Ready with Online Learning </b></p>
    <img src="https://oeson.b-cdn.net/New%20folder/best%20internship.jpg" class="image-left" alt="img"/>
    <p id="justify">The perception that most fresh graduates lack the necessary skills to get a job holds true and is fuelling the demand for online learning to help them upskill. There is no shred of doubt that online learning platforms offering specializations in various domains are a great way to help students get job-ready. In recent years online learning platforms have become hugely popular. Students get to choose from globally recognized courses from leading universities on online learning platforms like Coursera, Udemy, UpGrad, and even YouTube, to name a few. </p>
    
     <p id="justify">Online learning has two major advantages: easy accessibility and specialized courses to help you upskill. Students get to work on assignments and tasks designed to test their ability to apply their knowledge to solve a problem. If you pick up this skill, it will get you through a lot of challenges in your career with ease. </p>
     <p id="justify">With online learning, students have a choice to take up courses in their area of interest and choose to specialize in them. This gives them an edge in a highly competitive job market. </p>
    <br/>

    <p><b>Internships are also a Great Way to Upskill </b></p>
    <img src="https://oeson.b-cdn.net/New%20folder/two.jpg" class="image-right" alt="img"/>
    <p id="justify">With educational institutes in India lagging in terms of providing global exposure and expert mentorship from industry experts, more students are working as interns to bridge the gap between theory and practice.</p>
    
     <p id="justify">If you choose to work as an intern while you are still a student or just out of college exploring different options, you are on the right path. Internships are similar to working for an actual employer but the focus is more on learning. If you pick up the right skills during your internship, you will stand out among other applicants. You will have the clarity to help you get through job interviews.</p>
     <p id="justify">Online learning platforms offering specializations in various domains are a great way to help students get job-ready. A corporate environment teaches you a lot: people management to project management. Internships give you a headstart in this direction.

    <p><b>Can Internships help you Find a Job without Experience? </b></p>
    <p>No. An Internship can give you the much-needed confidence to find a job without experience. It is that simple. If you perform exceptionally well as an intern, you stand a chance to gain a glorious letter of recommendation or even an employment offer from the company.</p>
